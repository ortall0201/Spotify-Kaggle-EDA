I have created this EDA project (EDA -> Exploratory Data Science) during my Data Science course @ Naya College.
This is by far, my fav !! Please use the free version of Google Colab for better excution.
I love spotify and using this EDA gives spotify a new meaning. This was an eye-opener for sure. 
Just play the songs that came up during this EDA, by using your search button on Spotify and see for yourself.

Collaborated with Dror Etlinger.
